        <h1>examples:</h1>
        <p>A static website is just that - static. It is not dynamic. It does not change (frequently).</p>
        <p>An example might be a Restaurant's menu, but without order processing.</p>
        <p>text - anything written in plain English, or whatever language.</p>
        <p>images/logos/videos</p>
        <p>links to different pages - 'home';'about';'menu';etc;</p>
        <p>links to pages not on your site - amazon, facebook, paypal</p>
        <p>just about anything seen on the internet can be expressed as a single, static web page.</p>
        <p>this website is an example of a very simple static web page.</p>
        <p>a picture is worth a thousand words.</p>
        <br/>
        <br/>
        <p>a static website cannot have:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>user sign-in.</li>
            <li>payment processing.</li>
            <li>anything that might requrie a database.</li>
        </ul>

        <h1>how it works:</h1>
        <p>You explain to me your ideas during a "meeting".</p>
        <p>Think: word content, images, color schemes, etc.</p>
        <p>I do my best to implement those ideas over the next few days.</p>
        <p>Completely free of charge.</p>
        <br/>
        <br/>
        <p>When it comes time to make the site 'Live',
            we work together to find a no or low-cost hosting solution.
        </p>
        <p>At no point do you pay me.
            In most cases, there will be a fee for hosting.
        </p>
        <p>
            In other cases, hosting may be free.
        </p>
        <p>The idea is to add a no to low-cost entry point to being on the internet.</p>
