        <h1>how it works:</h1>
        <p>You explain to me your ideas during a "meeting".</p>
        <p>Think: word content, images, color schemes, etc.</p>
        <p>I do my best to implement those ideas over the next few days.</p>
        <p>Completely free of charge.</p>
        <br/>
        <br/>
        <p>When it comes time to make the site 'Live',
            we work together to find a low-cost hosting solution.
            At no point do you pay me.
            In most cases, there will be a fee for hosting.
        </p>
        <p>The idea is to add a very low-cost entry point to being on the internet.</p>
        <p>You don't pay a dev, you pay for hosting the site. Both of these range in price anywhere
            from free to cheap to expensive, depending on the content.
